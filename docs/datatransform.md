# JSON data model transformation

The bulk of the work here is in describing how we want different object models to map between one another.

# Steps

## check extras:
if a field is defined in the `extras` section then automatically map it to that section

## direct mappings:
license_title
maintainer
publish_state


# Data Map

in some cases the fields will move directly between the two schemas.
