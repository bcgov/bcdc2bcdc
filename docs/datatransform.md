# JSON data model transformation

The bulk of the work here is in describing how we want different object models to map between one another.

# Steps:

Each datatype has its own data transformation parameters.  For each data type
the transformation starts with reading the transformation configuration for that
type (users, groups, organizations, packages, resources).  The transformation
configuration file identifies things like:

* fields that are user generated vs autogenerated
* a user generated unique id field.
* fieldmapping paramaters identify autogenerated unique identifiers and user
  generated unique identifiers for the object type.  These values are used to
  translate autogenerated unique idenfiers on the source side their equivalents
  on the destination side
* specific user generated unique identifiers that should be skipped or ignored.
* autogenerated fields that must be included for updates
* default values






* Source data is retrieved from the API.
* Destination data is retrieved from the API
* Data is used to create a DataSet Object.  (opportunity for factory)
* DataSet objects are compared, deltas are stored in a CKANDataSetDeltas object
* Deltas are fed to update object that performs the updates.



## check extras:
if a field is defined in the `extras` section then automatically map it to that section

## direct mappings:
license_title
maintainer
publish_state


# Data Map

in some cases the fields will move directly between the two schemas.
